The architecture for this simple website will consist of two main files:

1. `app.py`: This is the main entry point of the application. It will contain the Flask application and the route for the homepage.

2. `index.html`: This is the HTML template for the homepage. It will contain the h1 tag with the text "Fabian was here".

3. `requirements.txt`: This file will list all the Python dependencies that need to be installed for the application to run.

Let's start with the `app.py` file:
