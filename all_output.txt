The architecture for this simple website will consist of two main files:

1. `app.py`: This is the main entry point of the application. It will contain the Flask application and the route for the homepage.

2. `index.html`: This is the HTML template for the homepage. It will contain the h1 tag with the text "Fabian was here".

3. `requirements.txt`: This file will list all the Python dependencies that need to be installed for the application to run.

Let's start with the `app.py` file:

app.py
```python
from flask import Flask, render_template

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    # This function handles the route for the homepage.
    # It renders the index.html template.
    return render_template('index.html')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

Next, let's create the `index.html` file:

index.html
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Simple Website</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Fabian was here</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

Finally, let's create the `requirements.txt` file:

requirements.txt
```txt
Flask==1.1.2
```

To run this application, you would first install the dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`, then run the application with `python app.py`. The website will be available at `http://localhost:5000`.

This is a very simple Flask application with a single route. The `app.py` file creates a Flask application and defines a route for the homepage (`/`). When this route is accessed, the `home` function is called, which renders the `index.html` template. The `index.html` file is a simple HTML document with a single h1 tag containing the text "Fabian was here".
